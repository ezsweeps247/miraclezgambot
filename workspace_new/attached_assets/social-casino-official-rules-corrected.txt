1. INTRODUCTION
1.1. Purpose of These Rules

These Rules govern the Standard Play functionality (often referred to as "Social Casino Mode"
or "Social Games") on the Platform. In Standard Play, you use Gold Coins—a purely
entertainment-focused virtual currency—without any real-money prizes. For rules regarding
sweepstakes-based Promotional Play, where Social/Sweeps Coins can be redeemed for
real-world prizes, please consult the Promotional Play or Official Sweepstakes Rules as
referenced in our T&C.

1.2. Relationship to the T&C

These Rules supplement and form an integral part of the overarching T&C. In the event of any
conflict between these Rules and the T&C, the T&C shall control. By engaging in Social Games,
you confirm you have read, understood, and consented to both these Rules and the T&C.

1.3. Key Points

   ●​ No Real-World Prizes: Social Games do not award monetary or otherwise redeemable
      prizes.​
   ●​ No Purchase Necessary: This principle primarily applies to sweepstakes (Promotional
      Play). You remain free—but not obligated—to purchase Gold Coins for additional
      in-game entertainment in Social Casino Mode.​
   ●​ Responsible Gameplay: You agree to play responsibly and in accordance with these
      Rules, our Responsible Social Gameplay Policy, and all relevant sections of the T&C.​

2. DEFINITIONS
Unless otherwise indicated in these Rules, all capitalized terms carry the same meanings
assigned to them in the T&C. By way of clarification:
   ●​ "Gold Coins": A non-redeemable, non-monetary virtual currency used exclusively for
      Social Games (Standard Play).​
   ●​ "Social Coins" or "Sweeps Coins": Sweepstakes entries used in Promotional Play,
      which may be redeemable for real-world prizes if won or otherwise awarded in
      accordance with the T&C.​
   ●​ "Platform": The Miraclez Gaming website, mobile applications, and any subdomains through
      which our Games or services are offered.​
   ●​ "Player," "you," or "your": Any individual who registers or otherwise participates in our
      Games.​

For additional legal definitions (e.g., "Excluded Territories," "AML/BSA," "KYC," "MSB," "MTL,"
etc.), please refer to the T&C.

3. ELIGIBILITY & ACCESS
3.1. Age Requirement

To participate in Social Games, you must be at least 18 years old or the legal age of majority in
your jurisdiction (whichever is higher). Individuals not meeting this criterion are strictly prohibited
from creating an account or using any Social Casino features.

3.2. Territorial Restrictions

Use or access from any Excluded Territory (as defined in the T&C) is disallowed. Any attempt
to bypass these territorial restrictions (e.g., via VPN or proxy services) constitutes a breach of
these Rules and may result in immediate account suspension or termination.

3.3. Single Account Policy

As stated in the T&C, each individual is limited to one Customer Account. Creating or
operating multiple accounts, whether to circumvent promotional limits or for any other reason,
violates both these Rules and the T&C.

3.4. Non-Transferable

You may not sell, assign, or transfer your Player Account, Gold Coins, or any privileges
associated with Social Casino Mode to another person or entity. Access to Social Games is
solely for your personal, non-commercial entertainment.

4. NATURE OF SOCIAL CASINO MODE
4.1. Gold Coins

   ●​ Virtual Currency Only: Gold Coins have no monetary value and cannot be redeemed
      for real money, merchandise, or any other tangible goods.​
   ●​ Initial & Promotional Allocations: Upon registration, you may receive complimentary
      Gold Coins. Additionally, we may periodically offer promotional or bonus Gold Coins
      (e.g., daily check-in, special events).​
   ●​ No Impact on Sweepstakes: Purchasing Gold Coins does not confer any advantage in
      Promotional Play (sweepstakes) and does not alter the odds of winning any real-world
      prize.​

4.2. No Real-Money Gambling

Social Casino Mode is for entertainment purposes only. No actual cash winnings or monetary
payouts exist in Standard Play. You acknowledge that any Gold Coins used or lost within Social
Games yield no real-money claims.

4.3. Purpose

Social Casino Mode aims to recreate the excitement of casino-style gameplay without financial
risk or reward. You may continue to play with freely awarded Gold Coins or choose to purchase
additional Gold Coins solely for added entertainment.

5. PURCHASING GOLD COINS
5.1. Voluntary Purchases

Purchasing additional Gold Coins is entirely optional. As stated in our T&C, you do not need to
buy anything to enjoy the Platform or its promotional sweepstakes. No purchase is ever
necessary to acquire or use the separate Social/Sweeps Coins for Promotional Play.

5.2. Payment Medium
In conformity with the T&C, any payment method you use (credit card, e-wallet, bank account,
etc.) must be legally and beneficially owned by you. Miraclez Gaming may request proof of
ownership or verification documents at its discretion (see T&C Section 11 regarding KYC and
SOF).

5.3. Refund Policy

All Gold Coin transactions are final. Miraclez Gaming does not generally issue refunds unless
mandated by law or expressly provided in consumer protection regulations. Attempted
chargebacks or reversals may lead to additional review, potential fees, and/or account closure
per the T&C.

5.4. Chargebacks & Fraud

If a transaction is disputed or charged back, we reserve the right to freeze or suspend your
account pending investigation. Repeated chargebacks or evidence of fraud may result in
permanent account termination and forfeiture of all virtual items or balances.

6. GAMEPLAY & PLATFORM RULES
6.1. Fair Participation

You must not use bots, scripts, hacking tools, cheats, or any unauthorized software or hardware
to manipulate or gain unfair advantage in Social Games. Violations may result in immediate
closure of your account, annulment of any in-game progress, and potential legal measures
under the T&C.

6.2. Conduct & User Interactions

   ●​ No Harassment or Hate Speech: Abusive, threatening, harassing, or hateful language
      in any Platform chat or public forum is strictly forbidden.​
   ●​ No Solicitation: You may not promote or facilitate the exchange or trading of Gold Coins
      or any external/competing services within the Platform.​
   ●​ Account Security: Keep your account credentials confidential, in line with T&C Section
      7.3. You are responsible for all activity under your login unless conclusively proven
      unauthorized.​

6.3. Technical Issues
   ●​ Voids/Resets: We reserve the right to void, annul, or reset any gameplay that is
      compromised by server errors, software malfunctions, or external disruptions.​
   ●​ No Liability: Miraclez Gaming accepts no responsibility for downtime, data loss, or user
      inaccessibility caused by maintenance, internet failures, or force majeure events (as
      further detailed in the T&C).​

6.4. Game-Specific Conditions

Each Social Game (e.g., virtual slots, blackjack, roulette) may have its own set of rules or
disclaimers. You bear sole responsibility for reviewing and understanding these individual game
mechanics and terms before playing.

7. RESPONSIBLE SOCIAL GAMEPLAY
7.1. Entertainment-Only Purpose

Our Social Casino environment is designed for amusement. You acknowledge that any
excessive or compulsive behaviors fall within your responsibility to manage or mitigate.

7.2. Self-Exclusion and Limits

If you believe your participation in Social Games is becoming problematic, you may contact
Player Support to request self-exclusion, cooling-off periods, or spending/playtime limits,
as detailed in our Responsible Social Gameplay Policy and Section 12 of the T&C.

7.3. Additional Policies

For access to third-party resources, helplines, or further details on responsible gaming, please
refer to the T&C or our dedicated Responsible Social Gameplay Policy.

8. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY & DISPUTES
8.1. No Cash Value

Because Gold Coins lack monetary value, any depletion or loss of Gold Coins within Social
Games gives rise to no compensable claim against Miraclez Gaming.

8.2. Disclaimer of Warranties

Social Casino Mode is provided "as is" and "as available," without any warranty or guarantee of
uninterrupted or error-free gameplay. For additional disclaimers, see Section 16 of the T&C.

8.3. Indemnification

You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Miraclez Gaming, its affiliates, and employees from any
damages, claims, or liabilities arising out of (i) your breach of these Rules, (ii) misuse of the
Platform, or (iii) unlawful conduct, as detailed in Section 24 of the T&C.

8.4. Arbitration & Class Waiver

All disputes relating to or arising from Social Casino Mode are subject to the Arbitration
Agreement and Class Action Waiver set forth in Section 26 of the T&C. By using Social
Games, you expressly waive the right to a jury trial or to participate in any class/collective
action.

9. MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS
9.1. Integration with T&C

These Rules are fully incorporated into and governed by the T&C. Any term or clause found
herein that conflicts with the T&C shall be superseded by the T&C.

9.2. Regulatory Considerations

Because Social Games do not involve real-money stakes, no gambling licenses are generally
required. However, Miraclez Gaming voluntarily complies with anti-money laundering (AML), Bank
Secrecy Act (BSA), money transmitter license (MTL), and MSB/FinCEN guidelines where
applicable. Please review Sections 28–29 of the T&C for additional details.

9.3. Playthrough Requirements

Certain bonus or promotional features within Social Casino Mode may be subject to
playthrough requirements before any redemption or withdrawal of potential bonus-related
rewards can occur. For additional information regarding such requirements—or if you have
specific questions about a promotional offer—please submit a support ticket or consult the
relevant sections of the T&C.

9.4. Updates
We reserve the right to amend, modify, or replace these Rules at any time. Substantive changes
will be posted on the Platform. Continued participation in Social Games after such posting
constitutes your acceptance of the new terms.
